## React Fundamentals Used in the Project
This project incorporates the following key React concepts:  
1. **Functional Components**: Used to create reusable and modular components.  
2. **React Hooks**:  
   - `useState`: For managing local state.  
   - `useEffect`: For handling side effects such as data fetching.  
   - `useContext`: For global state management via Context API.  
3. **Props and Prop Drilling**: To pass data between components effectively.  
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Render components conditionally based on state values.  
5. **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions like clicks and form submissions.

## Data Handling and Management
This project uses **Context API** for state management to manage and share data globally across components.
